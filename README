README file for ESDUpac Number A8913
ESDUpac Title:  TRANSVERSE (THROUGH-THE-THICKNESS) SHEAR STIFFNESSES
                OF FIBRE REINFORCED COMPOSITE LAMINATED PLATES


This diskette contains a copy, in ASCII format, of Program Number
A8913, associated with Data Item Number 89013 which is part of the
Structures Sub-series. Also included are example input and output files
corresponding to the worked examples in the Data Item.

It is essential that the Data Item be consulted for the full input/output
specification and interpretation. Limitations on the use of the program
are given in the Data Item. Guidance on copying, compilation and
running the program will be found in the introductory pages of the
Software Volume S/W 1. If you have any difficulty in using this
ESDUpac please contact ESDU International and we will do all we can
to assist you to overcome the problem.

Every reasonable effort has been made to ensure that the program performs
the intended calculations satisfactorily.  However, in common with other
providers of software no representation as to the suitability or fitness
of the program for any particular purpose is made and no liability for
any loss occasioned by any persons as a direct or indirect result of use
of the program whether arising from negligence or otherwise can be
accepted.  In no event shall ESDU or any individuals associated with the
development of the program be liable for any damages, including loss
of profit or consequential loss arising out of or in connection with
the program.

Program A8913.FOR has a total variable and array size greater than
64000 bytes. To use the program on an IBM DOS system it is necessary to
compile the source code with an option that will make use of multiple
data segments. For the Microsoft FORTRAN compiler, version 5.0, the
/Gt option must be used to compile program.

The files on this diskette and their sizes are listed below. If
the file sizes differ from those given then the files may have been
modified or possibly corrupted. If there is any doubt as to the
status of this ESDUpac master diskette a replacement should be
obtained from ESDU.
